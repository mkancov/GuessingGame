    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>Outside of work and school, my interests are typically things that keep me physically active and give me a challenge
      of some kind. I love doing Muay Thai, Boxing, and Jiu Jitsu and I find an hour a day to do one of them. I also enjoy
      working on cars and motorcycles and usually any kind of tinkering is fun for me in my free time. Being active along
      with working keeps me balanced and allows me to refocus myself after a long day.

    <h2>My Coding Story</h2>

    <p>For the past few years I have been working in the automotive industry, and ulitmately found that I wanted more.
      I like how much freedom the tech industry brings along with the job security and possibility of working remotely.
      My decision came down to cyber security vs software engineering, and obviously I ended up going the engineering route,
      because I felt that it came to me more naturally, and I have found enjoyement in doing this. I look forward to whatever 
      this journey holds and I am so happy that I decided to go with Code Fellows as my bootcamp experience.
